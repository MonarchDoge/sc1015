About
This is a Mini-Project for sc1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence)

# Problem Definition
How can we predict future covid deaths in Asia?

# Models Used
multi linear regression

# Conclusion
#### DOES ML SOLVE OUR OBJECTIVE?
Yes, to a large extent.
There are many variables not accounted for in the real world context, such as fast developing medication, which will have a strong correlation to the new number of deaths.
To be able predict the new number of deaths with a ~46% accuracy is valid.

Predictions are highly dependent on the current spreading regime.
Different additional variables would be beneficial
